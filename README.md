## Cryptotrader

A basic virtual cryptotrading prototype intended for person learning. Signed up users can use virtual money to buy & sell various cryptocoins. The exchange rate is updated real time, as is the portfolio and the summed value of the coins.

At the time of writing this, the prototype is hosted at: https://virtual-crypto-trading-app.herokuapp.com/

The prototype might not be hosted at this URL at a later time. If so, feel free to contact me if you want to see it in action.

The project was bootstrapped with Create-React-App. Other technologies used:

### Front-end

React, Redux, Redux-Observables (RxJs middleware for Redux), Reselect, Semantic UI

### Back-end

Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt
